# -Hate_Speech_Detection_BILSTM


With the increasing usage of the internet or particularly social media like Twitter
and Facebook, social media users take advantage of the anonymity provided on
such platforms to spread hate or offensive content for an individual or a group.
However, such platforms with broad audiences need to prevent abusive behavior
of the users, which they may not do in real life. Such activities by the users are
increasing day by day, which makes it difficult for the companies to monitor such
contents manually
This project is a basic implementation of BiLSTM for the detection of hate speeh on social media like twitter,facebook etc.
